                    <p>ABC-Gym offers a low-cost base membership and many walk-in classes that members pay
                        separately.</p>
                    <p>ABC-Gym’s revenue comes mainly from the classes, which the customers love because of the close
                        interaction they get with the instructors. In fact, some of these classes only have 3-5 spots to
                        ensure high quality workouts.</p>
                    <p>ABC-Gym works with many freelance instructors paid by the hour and sends them their rota one week in
                        advance.</p>


                    <h3>The problem</h3>
                    <p>The challenge that ABC-Gym faces is that when they plan the instructors’ rota (supply) they don’t
                        know exactly how many members will show up at the gym the next week (demand).</p>

                    <h3>The solution</h3>
                    <p>Alpha-i’s AI Demand Forecasting allows ABC-Gym to use all their gym usage and customer data and
                    augmented it with day-specific information (weather forecast, calendar events) to make week-ahead
                    forecasts for their gym attendance.</p>
